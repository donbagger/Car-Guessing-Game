## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to guess the correct combination of colored cars hidden behind a row of hidden car images. You have multiple attempts to guess the correct color and position of the cars. After each guess, you'll receive feedback on how many cars are in the correct color and how many are both the correct color and in the correct position.

### Difficulty Levels:
